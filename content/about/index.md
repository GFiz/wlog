## About Me

At heart, I'm a mathematician with a background in academic research. My work has focused primarily on probabilistic combinatorics and related areas. In particular I have worked in additive combinatorics, random graph processes and Ramsey theory. 

### About This Blog

This blog will serve as my digital notebook (inspired by Lilian Weng's [excellent blog](https://lilianweng.github.io)). Here, I hope to document my learning journey on various subjects I'm exploring, offering my unique perspective shaped by my ownbackground.

The content will range from technical deep-dives to intuitive explanations of complex concepts. My aim is to bridge the gap between rigorous mathematical formalism and practical applications. Perhaps, unusually, I want to bring as much as possible of the former to the latter.


### Research Interests

My current interests have moved from pure mathematics into more applied domains. I'm fascinated by recommender systems and the algorithms that help us navigate the vast landscape of choices in our digital world. Auction theory has captured my attention as well, with its elegant mathematical frameworks for understanding strategic behavior in markets. I'm also exploring reinforcement learning, particularly the mathematical foundations that enable machines to learn optimal decision-making through interaction with their environment.
